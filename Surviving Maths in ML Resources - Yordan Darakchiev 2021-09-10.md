Surviving Maths in ML

== Python ==
1. Jake VanderPlas, A Whirlwind Tour of Python (free book): https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/
== Basics of Data Science ==
1. Jake VanderPlas, Python Data Science Handbook (free book): https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/
* It will help you in your very first steps. For more advanced applications and code, you'll need to look at domain-oriented literature (e.g. financial analysis, image processing, bioinformatics, etc.)
2. Peter Bruce et al., Practical Statistics for Data Scientists (not free): https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics.../dp/149207294X
* Once again, very basics
3. Wes McKinney, Python for Data Analysis (not free): https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data.../dp/1491957662/
* I find this one really useful when you've mastered the basics and want to expand your knowledge a little. It's all about libraries, not math - so you need to know what you want to achieve. I'd recommend it just as a reference(edited)

== Linear Algebra ==
If you only have time to learn one topic, I'm begging you - learn linear algebra! I can't stress enough how important it is not only in ML, but in computer science / engineering / programming in general.
1. 3blue1brown, Essence of Linear Algebra: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab
    * 3blue1brown, need I say more?
2. Khan Academy (free course): https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra
    * You can focus on vector spaces and linear transformations but the entire course is useful
3. Philip Klein, Coding the Matrix (not free): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615880991/
    * I think this is the best linear algebra resource for programmers ever created. It's really interesting, easy to follow, and contains a lot of code and real-life examples. I recommend it greatly
4. Jim Hefferon, Linear Algebra (free book): https://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf
    * There are tons of linear algebra books online; some better than others. This is really good if you want to understand the math basics. It doesn't include code. Focus on chapters 2 (Vector Spaces), 3 (Maps between Spaces), and 5 (Similarity)
5. College-level courses (Warning: advanced stuff!)
    * MIT's course is hands-down the best. It's taught by one of the greatest people in linear algebra - Prof. Gilbert Strang. There are free videos online, and there's also a book: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/
    * Any other university course may do but I can't put anything else next to Prof. Strang's course

== Calculus ==
Focus on differentiation. Limits are useful, especially to understand how differentiation works. Integrals are useful as well, especially in the context of statistical distributions but you can get away with differentiation only.
1. 3blue1brown, Essence of Calculus: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr
    * Once again, really short intro, focusing mostly on visualizations and intuition. You won't get in-depth understanding but it's a good starting point if you've never seen calculus before
2. Khan Academy (free course): https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab
    * Focus on differentiation and applications
3. Khan Academy (free course): https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus
    * ML usually involves calculus in many dimensions (many variables). I recommend you check some essentials out. Focus on differentiation (chapters 2 and 3)
4. College-level courses (Warning: advanced stuff!)
    * Prof. Strang also has a Calculus book (free): https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/
    * Prof. David Jerison has the most popular course in MIT - I find it a bit too advanced for ML but if you really want to get in-depth, have a look: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/

== Statistics ==
1. Allan Downey, Think Stats (free book): https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/
    * I find this written in a very concise and easy to understand style. Includes code, not only math
2. Gopi Subramanian, Python Data Science Cookbook (not free): https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Cookbook-Subramanian/dp/1784396400
    * Recipes - very useful if you "kind of" know what you're doing but don't know how to do it
3. Khan Academy (free course): https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability
    * This covers a lot of ground but in a very basic level. Focus on the chapters for probability, random variables, Confidence Intervals and Significance tests
4. I wouldn't usually recommend an academic course for beginners but Introduction to Probability and Statistics by MIT is good: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/
5. Advanced (kind of, 1 level above the others): Any book / course on Bayesian methods. It's a simple idea but it's fundamental to many fields - not only ML. Once there, you'll also find Monte Carlo methods
6. College-level: any course tied to a domain works. Stats is a highly applied field. I recommend you focus on your domain(s) of choosing
== Other Useful Tidbits ==
Look at these only if you have the time, and / or are extremely interested. ML is multidisciplinary, and the intuitions / understanding you need is scattered all around maths.
1. Multivariable calculus: already discussed above. I think it's the first thing to know after you've gotten a grasp on the basics
2. Abstract algebra: notation and definitions are scary but once you get into them, they make things extremely useful.
3. Information theory: especially entropy
4. Signal processing: extremely useful for time series, but the concepts work for any dataset
5. Any field: applications
